# Hartshorne-Algebraic-Geometry-Solution
This is a collection of solutions to the exercises of Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometrye. This repository should be regarded as a complement to Joe Cutrone and Nick Marshburn's. That is, I only write solutions to the exercises that Joe Cutrone and Nick Marshburn's do not contain, or the solutions that are different from theirs.
